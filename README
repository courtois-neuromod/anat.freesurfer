# Courtois-NeuroMod: [anat subdataset, freesurfer derivatives](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/anat.freesurfer) 

The [Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod)](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour.

This repo contains the output from the freesurfer pipeline as integrated in fMRIPrep 20.0.x LTS series.
It is ran with the 2 first anatomical session as inputs, with T2w for surface refinement.

It also include flatmaps with [documentation](./doc/flatmaps.md) on how to use with pycortex.

Courtois NeuroMod data are [freely shared with the scientific community](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/ACCESS.html) to advance research at the interface of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Access to to the data is based on a registered access model, see the Courtois NeuroMod website for more information. Redistribution of data outside of the Courtois NeuroMod data bank is prohibited.
